  Abstract:
</h2>
<p>
  Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare but
aggressive primary liver cancer with limited treatment options
and poor outcomes. A defining feature of ICC is its immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), where immune
effector cells become functionally impaired. Although natural
killer (NK) cells are present in high numbers, they often exhibit
reduced cytotoxicity. The molecular mechanisms underlying this
dysfunction remain obscure. In this study, we analyzed two
ICC transcriptomic datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus
using CIBERSORTx to quantify resting and activated NK cell
populations. We then applied machine learning approaches to
identify genes that are associated with these NK cell functional
states across both datasets. Genes were filtered through variance
thresholding, ANOVA F-tests, recursive feature elimination, and
elastic net regression, followed by repeated resampling to identify
consistently enriched candidates. This work establishes an in
silico approach for connecting gene-level expression patterns to
immune cell dysfunction in solid tumors, and contributes to
future studies aimed at restoring NK cell function in ICC.
